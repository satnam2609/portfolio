      description="Compound Exchange is a high-performance stock exchange simulation built entirely in Rust, designed to replicate the core mechanics of real-world trading platforms. It features a multithreaded matching engine capable of handling concurrent order flows with low latency, using a finely tuned limit order book built with atomic operations and thread-safe structures. The system supports real-time order submissions, executions, and cancellations, and was built with a strong emphasis on performance, concurrency, and architectural clarityâ€”serving both as a practical backend project and a deep dive into systems-level programming."
